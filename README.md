# chat_server_socket_python

Hi i am Rahul Roshan G. Find something new here where you can find chat server between multiple clients with one server handling that. I have used tkinter, python and socket programming here for user
legible. Run the server first but first change the ip address of the server from "127.0.0.1" or local host to you ip address in both server and client [enter the server's
ip address in the client file so that it connects to server with no issue]. After that run client server you will get an GUI to enter the username enter that and you can't change the username again.
after that type the message in below box and press the button to send.

Happy coding.
